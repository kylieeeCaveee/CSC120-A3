Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

-I talked with Ella and Maggie about my code. Ella helped to remind me of including comments as I go for clear and consistent coding. Maggied and me discussed some of the differences between java syntax and python and different ways of finding and replacing things in strings. 
-I attended Professor Crouser's office hours on friday from 11-12. 
-I have worked with java before because I took AP comp sci in high school so I am adjusting pretty well. I like it a lot because it feels familiar and it is what I was use to coding in for a whole year. 
-I think for the most part programming is about problem solving and like do-able finding solutions to challenges. It is just the lingustuic differences that make it different because I approached the challenge in java the same way I would've in Python. 
-In the beginning, I got excited and just started coding a lot with out testing and going in a weird order. When I slowed down and started incrimentally testing things went a lot better and bugs were easier to find and fix. However, there is still a strange error saying there is an input I never closed, despite me closing the input. The advice I would give to someone taking the course in the future is to listen when the professors say go in order of the rubric and take breaks!
